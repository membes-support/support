## Target indicators

This widget allows you to set a range of organisational targets and will indicate whether or not you’re on track to meet the target.

Once the target has been set, the indicator will move and show if you are on target for this month or not. If you are on target, the needle will point to the middle. If you are ahead of target it will move to the right. If you are under target it will move to the left. The more ahead or under target you are, the further the needle will move to the left of the right.

The numbers in the middle of the indicator show \[ current value / target value \]. So using the Renewals indicator below, the target renewals for this month is 5, and so far this month there has been 1.
