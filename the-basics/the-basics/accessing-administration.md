To login, use the supplied administrator username and password. As an administrator you will be able to set up additional staff logins.

If you have been provided with your username and password by another administrator, and are not able to login, ask them to check that they have given your profile administration access.

> [!TIP]
> For security reasons, you will be logged out after 20 minutes if admin is left idle.

> [!CAUTION]
> **IMPORTANT:** Administrators accessing any locked/member only pages on the public website must also be logged into admin in order to view the locked pages.
