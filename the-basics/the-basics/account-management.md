## Billing

> Membes customers have the option to pay their monthly invoice via EFT or using a stored credit card. Customers who choose to store a credit card can enjoy the ‘set and forget’ convenience of automatic monthly invoice payments.
> 
> A notification is issued on the first business day of the month to let customers know their invoice is available to be viewed, and that the stored credit card will be debited within the next 48 hours.

> [!TIP]
> If you have any questions about your invoice you can submit a [billing enquiry form](https://resources.membes-ams.com/billing).
